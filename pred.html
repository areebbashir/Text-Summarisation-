Moving to the cafeteria going to the bathroom and working in their classroom may be brand new concepts to them. Have students wear nametags with their name their school and their teacher name for the first week or two. Not only will this help teachers and other support staff learn their names but it will also help ensure their safety during transition and dismissal time. And have spare nametags couple of students will mysteriously lose theirs. Lunch Plan If your school provides kindergarteners with lunch know how each student will eat lunch.

Minimize transition times as much as possible. For example once students have put up their pencils they may continue to independently work on their coloring activity while the other students put up their pencils. Lines Keep the lunch line moving money is out and ready or keep the water fountain line moving each student has ten seconds to drink water then back to line Stop the line every so often to check that it remains straight and students are quiet. If student loses shoe someone always will have that student step out of line to fix the shoe while the line continues. When the line to stop the student may walk back to his or her place or remain at the end. Keep Students Busy Whole group instruction may include calendar or story time. Small group activities should be structured. For example ul li Show the kids how to build patterns with blocks and give visible examples so they ll know what is expected. li li Show them how to match lowercase and uppercase letters.

The hypothesis is way of predicting your end results in written form. However the initial prediction is always null and you can form other hypotheses based on sample data that is tested. On the other hand planning the research design involves the approach you will use when collecting and analyzing data. The research design you pick will determine the statistical tests you will use when testing your hypothesis later. The research design can be experimental cause and effect correlation relationship between variables or descriptive. Collecting sample data In statistical report writing collecting data can be expensive and bit hard. That is why when conducting given analysis you simply collect data from sample. Through your findings you can now apply statistical analysis to get the results as long as you follow the right procedure. You can create reliable sampling procedure by considering the following aspects ul li Define how you will get the participants based on the available resources li li Determine how far you can go based on the available resources li li Determine the means you will use to recruit the sample representation li li Plan on your time effectively i.e. when to follow up on your sample. li ul Use descriptive statistics to summarize the data After collecting sample data you need to analyze and summarize it using descriptive statistics. Here you can use the following approaches when inspecting the data. ul li Using the graphs and tables to visualize the data li li Using scatter plot to visualize two variables li li Using frequency distribution tables to organize data li li Using bar chart to display data to view distribution responses li ul Hypotheses testing statistic is number describing sample while parameter describes population. You can use inferential statistics to determine conclusions about the research based on the sample statistics. Here most researchers use estimation and hypothesis testing methods simultaneously to make inferences in statistics. Estimation involves calculating the parameters of the population based on sample statistics while hypothesis testing involves testing research predictions using the samples. Results interpretation This is the final step when writing statistical analysis report. When writing the hypothesis testing the goal is to get the criteria for getting to conclusions whereby you your value against significant level to determine if the statistics are significant or not. When the results are statistically significant then it could have happened</td>

However with this approach the satisfaction of doing job well can often get lost in the drive for praise and promotion. Research on employee engagement suggests that people perform better when they re motivated. But there still widespread debate about whether traditional motivational strategies like stick and carrot really work. So in this article we explore model that casts away the idea of reward and punishment as motivational tools and instead focuses on what it takes to make people really care about what they do. What Is Motivation In his book aqmvvrw drive Drive Daniel Pink sets out new vision for workplace motivation which he labels Motivation It called this he explains because it an upgrade from primitive survival Motivation and from the culture of reward and punishment that we find in most businesses Motivation Pink theory is drawn from research undertaken by psychologists Harry Harlow and Edward Deci in They discovered that rewards can fail to improve people engagement with tasks and may even damage it. Another study was carried out by professors at MIT in and recorded similar findings. Pink argues that traditional aqut carrots and sticks carrot and stick approaches to motivation are be outdated and do not adequately address the needs of the creative and innovative workplaces of the st century. Despite this extrinsic motivation or Type behavior motivating people using rewards external to work is often deep rooted particularly among older employees who are accustomed to it. In contrast intrinsic motivation or Type behavior when people are self motivated because they re given the freedom to do the work they enjoy is increasingly in modern workplaces where routine work is often outsourced. In these kinds of environments innovation and creativity are key. So it essential that people are allowed to thrive by doing work that they re truly passionate about. Tip You can learn more about the different approaches to motivation in our article ak nc how to motivate your team Motivation The Three Key Components of Intrinsic Motivation According to Pink intrinsic motivation is based on three key factors Autonomy Mastery and Purpose. Let look at each factor in more detail Autonomy ar eb the demand control model of job stress Autonomy is the need to direct your own life and work. To be fully motivated you must be able to control what you do when you do it and who you do it with.

By rethinking traditional ideas of control regular office hours dress codes numerical targets and so on organizations can increase staff autonomy build trust and improve innovation and creativity.

The health problems can be related to the skin and be minor in severity or can affect the whole body and be much more serious. In either case fire ant sting treatment is re to lessen the symptoms or prevent serious health br Before discussing symptoms and possible treatments for fire ant bite it is necessary to provide some basic information about fire ants. br Information About Fire Ants There are many different species of ants. Ants live in colonies that range from to over one million ants. Some ants bite or sting while others do not. One type of ant that does sting is the fire ant. br What is fire ant and how do you identify one Fire ants can look like ordinary house or garden ants. However their bodies and antennae are different. More specifically fire ant is small and coppery brown to black in color on the head and body. The abdomen is darker. The length of fire ants varies from to mm. They can be distinguished from other ants due to their rather aggressive behaviour especially near their nest. br Fire ant nests have no obvious entry or exit points because the openings are small. Their nests or mounds are dome shaped and can be quite large up to cm high by cm in diameter and meter or more deep. They nest preferentially in moist soil areas. The mounds can be found next to objects on the ground such as wood rocks paving stones and bricks. They can also be found in sunny open areas such as lawns uncultivated farmland or pastures and along the side of roads rivers and ponds. Unfortunately sometimes fire ants also nest indoors and can be serious home pest. Common indoor nesting spots are inside wall cavities electrical boxes drawers and in attics. These types of ants are found throughout the United States especially the southern states. Fire ants can also be found in South America Australia the Philippines Taiwan and China. The Fire Ant Bite or Sting Fire ants generally mind their own business. However bite is more likely to occur when the ant or its mound is disturbed. If this occurs many aggressive ants will swarm the threat in few seconds. When fire ant stings or bites it first grabs the skin with its mandibles. This anchors the ant so that it can thrust its abdominal stinger and venom into the victim skin. The problem is that fire ants do not bite or sting only once. In fact one fire ant will sting relentlessly. This multiple stinging or biting or stings is usually in circular pattern around the area where the fire ant anchored itself. In addition encounters with fire ants usually involve several or up to hundred ants. Therefore the amount of bites from fire ants in an attack can be significant with each one of those fire ants stinging multiple times. Fire Ant Bite Symptoms fire ant delivers very painful and burning sting to its victims. This fiery burning pain is intensified because of the likelihood of multiple bites or stings. It is for this reason that the fire ant got its name. Other symptoms can be divided into minor reactions that generally affect only the skin or more serious allergic reactions. br Minor Bite Reactions In addition to the fiery type stinging pain which will last an hour at least but potentially several hours fire ant bite will cause welt or hive to develop at each sting site. small blister will then form on the skin at the sting sites within to hours. The fluid in the blister then be cloudy. The area around the sting sites may swell itch and be red in color</td>

Or maybe you advice buy should you buy smokers house purchased the home of smoker Either way it time to clear the air Cigarette smoke smell after all isn just an aesthetic issue. According to http tobaccocontrol.bmj.com content study published in third hand smoke the carcinogenic toxins that cigarette smoke deposits on walls floors and dust lingers for months after smokers move out exposing nonsmoking new owners especially children and pets to unhealthy chemicals. Cigarette smoke can pollute the indoor air quality in your home and cause asthma headaches nausea fatigue and an increased risk for lung cancer explains strong Richard Ciresi strong the owner of Aire Serve in Louisville KY. And one magazine.realtor daily news how much cigarette smoke decreases resale value survey found that house sold by smoker can lower the value of home by up to If you re selling you re not legally obligated to disclose that home has been smoked in. Nonetheless strong smell will quickly clue in potential buyers and could make your home harder to sell. The good news It is possible with some hard work to get smoke smell out of house. Here what to do. Air it out Your first step is to advice home improvement how to improve air quality at home coronavirus improve the air quality of the house as much as possible and obviously stop smoking inside Opening up your windows and letting in the fresh air is an easy step to rid your home of built up pollutants explains Ciresi. An air filter especially HEPA model with charcoal odor filter will help eliminate dust and particulate matter. Ciresi also suggests using dehumidifier in rooms with heavy smoke smell. Moist air holds odors and will make the smell more intense. Drying out the air will help the smell to dissipate. Deal with the drywall Drywall tends to soak up any smells it subjected to on regular basis says Ciresi. Unfortunately replacing the drywall in your home isn really an option. Instead thoroughly wash your walls and ceiling removing any dust from door frames window frames baseboards fan blades and light fixtures. You can clean with vinegar or even better mixture of trisodium phosphate TSP and water. If the smell persists you might have to repaint the room using sealing odor killing primer like Kilz. Without sealing primer the smell will eventually start to seep back in through the paint. Make sure to repaint the ceiling too since it will have had the most exposure to smoke. Clean the carpets Carpeting is notorious absorber of odors. If you have wall to wall carpet you can try sprinkling baking soda or an odor reducing product on the carpet then vacuuming. But you may have to get the carpets professionally steam cleaned. If the smell is really serious carpets may have to be removed or replaced entirely. For wood or tile floors regular mopping should be sufficient but if you re noticing smell from the floor try mopping with vinegar or the TSP mixture. Examine your HVAC evaporator coil</td>

Students use the design process to create their own pop up books. Before they begin they must build foundation of knowledge of both storytelling and paper engineering. Many students have seen pop up book before but few if any have asked themselves How can make this To build the foundation of knowledge my supervisor encouraged me to adopt SOLE as my main approach. was intrigued yet nervous. wanted to empower students to take more responsibility over their own learning yet so much about the approach went against my teaching instincts. What would it look like if were to hand over the majority of my minute class period to my students To my surprise my journey with SOLE has exceeded my expectations and greatly impacted my practices. SOLE is an effective method for fostering student centered learning for middle school students and can work well for all grade levels. Use SOLE to Introduce New Concepts SOLE is not meant to be the only method of teaching in classroom. Consider it tool for introducing and generating interest in new topic as well as broadening your students understanding of familiar topic. SOLE practitioners re that you use it about once week for the first three weeks after you introduce it. To prepare your SOLE session formulate big question related to your topic that will lead your students to an intended out Crafting the big question is the most challenging piece of the SOLE puzzle it important that it be question that cannot be answered through an internet search. For example ul li Weak Big Question What is the design process li li Strong Big Question How can use the design process to create li ul Post your big question on the board and spend no more than two minutes explaining it. Tell students they have the majority of the period to work in small groups to up with an answer and that they will share out their answers at the end of class. It helpful to make timer available so students can manage their time appropriately. Allow Group Flexibility In SOLE students can choose their research groups. And groups are fluid which means students can switch groups throughout the period moving to group that is more aligned with their interests. Initially the idea of group fluidity did not naturally for me or for the students. noticed that some of them formed certain groups simply because they already knew one another. But because groups are formulated on interests it important that students feel working with those they don know as well. It useful to set up frequent getting to know you activities. As students became more familiar with each other their curiosity began to trump their desire to be with friends. watched students move from one group to another because they either wanted to remove themselves from potentially distracting situation or were more interested in another group direction of research. Make Sure Resources Are Available to Students provide links to several websites and tutorials ve found that relate to the big questions ask my students to explore. This not only saves time but provides students with starting point for their research. Through formative assessment was surprised to learn that my students don all prefer technology when it to research and self teaching. For that reason always provide an array of options for their research. My classroom research library contains books textbooks articles and model texts. Self Evaluation Exit Tickets My main objective for starting with SOLE was to foster an environment for student self management and self reliance.

He will express it one way or another be it using body language the way he interacts with you or how much his friends know about you.
